1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to extract the information enfolded in the data and summarize the main characteristics of the data.



Project:Food Delivery Time Exploratory Data Analysis

Project Overview:Data visualization helps in presenting billions of data points into meaningful insights. It is a very important tool for all data scientists to learn and

understand the data in more detail. Visualization also helps business leaders to take important decisions for company growth and to move in the right direction.

We often order food from food delivery apps like Zomato, Swiggy. Sometimes it often takes time to deliver the food. There are factors that impact the delivery time of the food.

In this, we are going to work on a data visualization challenge to analyse and visualize the food delivery time from the same location but different cuisines and ratings of the restaurants.
